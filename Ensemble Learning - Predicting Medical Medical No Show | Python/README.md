# Patient Behavior Study: Medical No Show | Python, Jupyter
I tapped into my passion for healthcare to explore a large dataset of medical appointment history, where I designed and ran a series of data analysis experiments to understand why patients were missing their appointments. Moreover, I investigated and tested different machine learning algorithms including Naïve Bayes, Ensemble (begging, boosting, and stacking), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the optimal predictive model for capturing no-show patients.

* Linear SVM, capturing 77% (recall) of no-show cases
* 'Age' is the most important feature
* Resolved imbalanced Class issue using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
